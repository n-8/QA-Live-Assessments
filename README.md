# QA Live Assessments

This project is intended at being an interactive Live Assessment for QA Automators with Interesting Challenges and to Evaluate the Use of Industry Standard QA Automator Techniques.

## Getting Started

This repository is a test project with challenges to give to candidates for the QA Automator role at [Number8](http://number8.com).  It consists of a Behavioral-Driven Delveopment project using Page Object Model (POM) to test the site application for a [Zoo Web App](https://qa.number8.com)

### Prerequisites

```

Java Virtual Machine (JVM) version 8 or higher
Eclipse IDE (MAC, Windows, etc.)
Maven (Ideally integrated with Eclipse IDE)

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

### Step 1:  Install and test JVM
